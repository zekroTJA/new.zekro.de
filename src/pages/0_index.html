<h1>hey</h1>
I am Ringo Hoffmann; professional Backend and DevOps engineer at
<a href="https://b12-touch.de/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">B12-touch</a>
with professional development experience since 2017.

<br />
<br />

Currently, I am mainly working with Go, Rust, Python, TypeScript and Bash.
Mostly, I am working on a lot of backend and tooling stuff as well as on
infrastructure as code projects.

<br />
<br />

Most of my publicly available work can be found on my
<a href="https://github.com/zekrotja/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub</a>
profile. Or feel free to take a detour through my
<a href="/projects/">projects overview</a> on my web page.

<h2>Interesting things to continue on!</h2>

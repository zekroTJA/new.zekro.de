I am Ringo Hoffmann <a href="https://pronouns.org/what-and-why" target="_blank" rel="noopener">(he/him)</a>;
professional Backend and DevOps engineer at
<a href="https://b12-touch.de/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">B12-touch GmbH</a>

Currently, I am mainly working with Go, Rust, Python, TypeScript and Bash. Mostly, I am working on a lot of backend and
tooling stuff as well as on infrastructure as code projects.

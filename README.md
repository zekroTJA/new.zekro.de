# üåê [zekro.de](https://zekro.de)

Here you find the sources of my personal web page. It is built using vanilla HTML, CSS and a tiny bit of JavaScript. Also, it is built using my own static site generator [temple](https://github.com/shellshape/temple) to allow some templating and avoid code duplication.
